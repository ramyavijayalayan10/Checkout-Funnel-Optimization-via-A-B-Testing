## ✏️ Project Summary

In this end-to-end A/B testing project, I designed a simulated, streamlined checkout funnel variant and tested its performance against a control group. Using Proportions Z-test and Chi-square segmentation, I found a **5.66% uplift** in conversion. My analysis demonstrates business-focused experimentation, behavioral segmentation, and strong statistical grounding.

## 🧱 Experimental Design

| Group     | Funnel Structure                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Control   | Search → Cart → Bill and Personal Details → Payment Confirmation |
| Variant   | Streamlined Search → Unified Cart → Payment Confirmation |

- **Streamlined Search**: Fewer filters, smarter suggestions, faster browsing
- **Unified Cart**: Pre-saved personal details, coupon fields, and billing info to reduce friction

---

## 📂 Data Preparation

### ✔️ Merged Multi-Source Data

- Joined five page-level datasets into a unified `control_df`
- Simulated `variant_users_df` by modifying funnel steps
- Created unified cart structure, removed details page
- Final conversion defined as:  
  ```python
  ab_data_df['converted'] = ab_data_df['payment_confirmation']
  ```

## 📊 Key Performance Metrics

- 🔄 **Conversion Rate - Control Group**: 0.50%  
- 🚀 **Conversion Rate - Variant Group**: 6.16%  
- 🎯 **Uplift from Variant**: +5.66 percentage points

## 📐 Proportions Z-Test

```python
Z-statistic ≈ 67.09  
P-value ≈ 0.0000
```
---
## 📐 Confidence Interval

```python
95% Confidence Interval for the Uplift is: [5.50%, 5.83%]
```
---

## ✅ Conclusion

Statistically significant improvement.  
The streamlined funnel increases conversions by **5.66 percentage points**, validating the hypothesis.

## 🧠 Behavioral Segmentation via Chi-Square Tests

### Gender vs. Conversion

| Gender | Conversion Rate |
|--------|------------------|
| Female | 3.45%            |
| Male   | 3.21%            |

📊 **Chi-square = 7.8393**  
🧪 **p-value = 0.0051** → **Significant difference**

---

### Device vs. Conversion

| Device  | Conversion Rate |
|---------|------------------|
| Mobile  | 5.14%            |
| Desktop | 2.42%            |

📊 **Chi-square = 922.2552**  
🧪 **p-value ≈ 0.0000** → **Highly significant difference**

---

## 🏁 Final Takeaways

- ✅ Hypothesis confirmed — simplified funnel yields **+5.67% conversion gain**
- 📱 Mobile-first design crucial: Mobile converts **>2×** better than desktop
- 👩 Gender shows subtle conversion differences
- 🎯 Streamlining steps leads to tangible business impact
